Title: Online Book Store - Project Execution

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT?


The Online Book Store project was developed and executed locally using XAMPP, a popular web development environment that provides Apache web server, MySQL database, and PHP support. Follow the steps below to run the project on your own machine using XAMPP:

1. Download and Install XAMPP:
   - Visit the official XAMPP website (https://www.apachefriends.org) and download the appropriate version of XAMPP for your operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install XAMPP on your computer.

2. Set Up the Project:
   - Download the project files (HTML, CSS, PHP, and database files) from the provided source.
   - Extract the project files into the `htdocs` folder of your XAMPP installation directory. For example, if you installed XAMPP on Windows, the `htdocs` folder is typically located at `C:\xampp\htdocs`.

3. Start XAMPP and Launch Apache and MySQL:
   - Open the XAMPP Control Panel. On Windows, you can do this by running the `xampp-control.exe` application.
   - Start the Apache web server and MySQL database by clicking on the "Start" button next to their respective modules. The status indicators should turn green when they are running successfully.

4. Import the Database:
   - Launch a web browser and enter `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in the address bar. This will open the phpMyAdmin interface.
   - Create a new database by clicking on the "New" button and providing a name for the database (e.g., `bookstore`).
   - Select the newly created database from the left-hand sidebar.
   - Click on the "Import" tab and choose the SQL file provided with the project. This file contains the necessary tables and data for the online bookstore.
   - Click "Go" to import the SQL file into the database.

5. Access the Online Book Store:
   - Open a web browser and enter `http://localhost/project-folder` in the address bar, where `project-folder` is the name of the folder where you placed the project files.
   - The homepage of the Online Book Store should appear, and you can start exploring and interacting with the website.

Others can run the project by following these steps:

1. Download the project files from the provided source (e.g., GitHub repository).
2. Install XAMPP following the steps described above.
3. Place the downloaded project files in the `htdocs` folder of the XAMPP installation directory.
4. Import the database using phpMyAdmin.
5. Access the project by entering `http://localhost/project-folder` in a web browser, where `project-folder` is the name of the folder where the project files are located.

By following these steps, you can successfully run the Online Book Store project locally using XAMPP and share it with others who want to experience the online bookstore on their own machines.

Note: Make sure to update the "project-folder" placeholder with the actual name of the folder where you placed the project files.
